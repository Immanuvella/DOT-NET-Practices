    <h2 id="topic1">Websites</h2>

    <p>A website is a collection of many web pages, and web pages are digital files that are written using
        HTML(HyperText Markup Language). To make your website available to every person in the world, it must be stored
        or hosted on a computer connected to the Internet round a clock. Such computers are known as a Web Server.The
        website’s web pages are linked with hyperlinks and hypertext and share a common interface and design. The
        website might also contain some additional documents and files such as images, videos, or other digital assets.

        With the Internet invading every sphere, we see websites for all kinds of causes and purposes. So, we can also
        say that a website can also be thought of as a digital environment capable of delivering information and
        solutions and promoting interaction between people, places, and things to support the goals of the organization
        it was created for.A static website is one that has Web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client Web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered "static" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as a classic website, a five-page website or a brochure website are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.

        Static websites may still use server side includes (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As the site's behavior to the reader is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.</p>

    <h2 id="topic2">Smart Phones</h2>

    <p>The term smartphone refers to a handheld electronic device that provides a connection to a cellular network.
        Smartphones were introduced to the world in 1994 by IBM but have since expanded to include companies like Apple
        and Samsung.

        Although they were originally meant to allow individuals to communicate via phone and email, smartphones now
        allow people to access the internet, play games, and send text messages in addition to making phone calls and
        sending emails.The world's first smartphone was created by IBM in 1994. Nicknamed Simon, the smartphone included
        revolutionary features including a touchscreen, email, and built-in apps including a calculator and a sketch
        pad. Cellular phone functionality has continued to improve since then, especially in the years after 2000. By
        2007, Apple (AAPL) released its groundbreaking iPhone.

        When iPhone 3G was released in 2008,

        there were more than 3.6 billion mobile connections around the world.A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone functions and computing functions into one unit. They are distinguished from older-design feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, access to the internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-installed and third-party software (such as a magnetometer, a proximity sensor, a barometer, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and more), and support wireless communication protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation). More recently, smartphone manufacturers have begun to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into devices for use in remote regions where there is no reliable cellular network.

        Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late 2000s, the majority of smartphones have featured thin, slate-like form factors with large, capacitive screens with support for multi-touch gestures rather than physical keyboards and have offered the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized store and use cloud storage and synchronization, virtual assistants, as well as mobile payment services. Smartphones have largely replaced personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, handheld/palm-sized PCs, portable media players (PMP),[1] and, to a lesser extent, handheld video game consoles.</p>

    <h2 id="topic3">Digital Television</h2>

    <p>Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of television signals using digital encoding, in contrast to the
        earlier analog television technology which used analog signals. At the time of its development it was considered
        an innovative advancement and represented the first significant evolution in television technology since color
        television in the 1950s.[1] Modern digital television is transmitted in high-definition television (HDTV) with
        greater resolution than analog TV. It typically uses a widescreen aspect ratio (commonly 16:9) in contrast to
        the narrower format of analog TV. It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit
        up to seven channels in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel,[2] and provides many new features that
        analog television cannot. A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2000. Different digital
        television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely
        used standards. in contrast to the earlier analog television technology which used analog signals.

    <h2 id="topic4">eBooks</h2>

    <p>We live in the age of electronic everything. eCommerce, eBanking, eTickets, eGift Cards, eCigarettes, and the
        list goes on.

        Why? Because people love the idea of doing everything from virtually anywhere on any device. With that being
        said, it’s no surprise that we’ve started revolutionizing the way we do just about everything.

        What started as a way to make everyday activities easier has made its way to our leisure activities: reading
        being one that comes to my mind right away. We’ve introduced eBooks as a way of making one of America’s favorite
        pastimes that much easier.

        Surprised? I’m not. But, what exactly is an eBook and what can it do? You’d think it’s what it sounds like, an
        electronic book. However, it’s a little more complicated than that.

        The main reasons for people buying e-books are possibly lower prices, increased comfort (as they can buy from home or on the go with mobile devices) and a larger selection of titles.[5] With e-books, "electronic bookmarks make referencing easier, and e-book readers may allow the user to annotate pages."[6] "Although fiction and non-fiction books come in e-book formats, technical material is especially suited for e-book delivery because it can be digitally searched" for keywords. In addition, for programming books, code examples can be copied.[6] In the U.S., the amount of e-book reading is increasing. By 2014, 28% of adults had read an e-book, compared to 23% in 2013. By 2014, 50% of American adults had an e-reader or a tablet, compared to 30% owning such devices in 2013.[7]

        Besides published books and magazines that have a digital equivalent, there are also digital textbooks, that are intended to serve as the text for a class and help in technology-based education.

    <h2 id="topic5">Blogs</h2>

    <p>A blog description is a short summary of what your blog is about. In the context of SEO, we are talking about the
        meta description which shows up in search listings and social media shares.

        By the way, this is the meta tag. A Meta description tag is a special HTML meta tag that tells a computer, such
        as Google what the entire page is about.If you think about it, a description is just like a summary of your
        blog. Since you have picked a central topic for your blog, you should have a one-liner tagline for your site.
        This tagline can be used on top of your blog just like I have set my tagline in my blog.

        An SEO meta description has the option to go beyond one line and allows you to further explain the topic, who is
        it for and what are the sub-topics you are going to cover.

        The blog description is independent of your blog content and is actually part of the meta-information. When you
        write a description, it will not appear anywhere in your blog but it always derives from the source content.

        We have a description for the main blog, yourblog.com which is the most important meta-information we can have
        for the site.

        Every other blog articles act as an individual entity in the eyes of Google so each of the blog articles and
        pages can also have their unique blog description.Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education, blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very short posts.

        'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram. Blogging is writing about what you like. In other words, writing about what you know and providing valuable information to people searching for it.</p>
